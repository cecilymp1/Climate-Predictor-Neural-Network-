The goal of this analysis is to explore how urban planners and environmental policymakers can
use this insight to make informed decisions about where to invest in infrastructure improvements and
climate resilience initiatives. With climate change affecting coastal cities such as Boston with rising sea
levels, the community must be warned and protected from such hazards that are a side effect of our
changing climate (Rosen 2021). By concentrating on areas and factors identified as high-risk, the state can
prioritize funding and resources for measures like coastal barriers, building elevation, and reforestation to
mitigate damage from sea level rise and storms (City of Boston 2016). Being able to model the climate
change elements impacting land value estimates can also empower individuals to make informed
decisions about where they choose to live in the future (Palter 2022). To convince policymakers and
future homeowners of these changing conditions and their potential impact on future residences, this
study examines the ability of neural networks to predict land value estimates and assesses how climate
factors affect them.
